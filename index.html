        <h2>Why Human Umpires Matter</h2>
        <p>Baseball umpires have been a crucial part of the game since its inception. Unlike many other sports where referees make calls on various actions, umpires in baseball have one of the most scrutinized roles: calling balls and strikes. Their job is challenging because they must make split-second decisions on pitches that can reach speeds over 100 mph. A single call can change the outcome of a game, which is why there is so much debate over the **human element of umpiring** versus the use of **robot umpires**.</p>
        <p>Many fans and analysts argue that umpires bring **tradition, adaptability, and a personal touch** to baseball that technology cannot replicate. Umpires develop an instinct for the game, allowing them to adjust for unique circumstances, such as how different batters set up in the box. On the other hand, others believe that technology should take over to ensure 100% accuracy in balls and strikes. However, even with **Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) technology**, human umpires still play a critical role in enforcing rules and managing the game.</p>
