        <h2>The Strike Zone</h2>
        <p>The strike zone is defined as the area over home plate between the batterâ€™s knees and the midpoint of their torso. Umpires must judge the pitch in real time, leading to slight variations.</p>

        <h3>Challenges in Calling Strikes</h3>
        <p>Each batter has a different stance, meaning the strike zone **changes** based on their height and how they position themselves. Umpires rely on experience, positioning, and consistency to make the right calls.</p>
